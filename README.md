## STATE
Release 2.4 R0 Stable  
ESP-IDF v3.3.6  

See also the version for ESP-IDF v4.4 at    
   https://github.com/karawin/KaRadio32_4

Works on any esp32 board.  
See the boards directory for a list of pre-configured boards.  
See : [Hardware configuration partition](HardwareConfig.md)
- The esp32 adds the output on the internal dac or with i2s to an external dac but only mp3 stations can be played.  
Adding a vs1053 board, all stations can be played.  
On a wrover cpu with external psram, every AAC streams can be played without the vs1053 board.  
- Compatible with esp8266 KaRadio addons.  
- Serial or telnet commands : [Interfaces description](Interface.md)
### Android remote command
A new android application is born: 
  
- KaRadio Remote Control by Vassilis Serasidis on google Play.

It is an easy and fast WiFi remote control for your KaRadio or KaRadio32 hardware.  
With this android app you can select the WebRadio station you want to play, set the volume and get the station information such as Station name, Genre, Bit rate, Meta data and more.   
Found it at

## Configure the hardware and IR codes
If the default configuration doesn't fit your needs, you can externally configure the software to fit your hardware and peripherals to suit your needs.  
The configuration file is to be flashed only one time. After, the standard delivery will become compatible with your hardware gpio use and peripherals configuration. A future standard OTA will automatically works for your configuration.  
See : [Hardware configuration partition](HardwareConfig.md)  
For a wrover cpu you need a csv file with psram in the name. Without it, the default configuration will fail.  

## Build your own
=======  
To build your own release if you want to do some improvments, you must install the idf https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf and the toolchain. The esp-idf release is the 3.3.5  

### ESP-IDF Patch
Since the 3.3.5 and upper releases there is a bug with CONFIG_SPIRAM_IGNORE_NOTFOUND 
You need to patch the esp\esp-idf\components\esp32\spiram.c line 128 to  
```
esp_spiram_size_t esp_spiram_get_chip_size()
{
    if (!spiram_inited) {
#if CONFIG_SPIRAM_IGNORE_NOTFOUND
         ESP_EARLY_LOGE(TAG, "SPI RAM not initialized");
		 return ESP_SPIRAM_SIZE_INVALID;
#endif		
		 abort();
    }
```
See https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf/issues/6063#issuecomment-1010899552  
  

To flash all build output, run 'make flash' or :

```
esptool \
   --chip esp32 --port /dev/ttyUSB0 --baud 921600 --before default_reset \
   --after hard_reset write_flash -u --flash_mode dio \
   --flash_freq 40m --flash_size detect \
   0x1000 $HOME/esp/Ka-Radio32/build/bootloader/bootloader.bin \
   0x10000 $HOME/esp/Ka-Radio32/build/KaRadio32.bin \
   0x8000 $HOME/esp/Ka-Radio32/build/partitions.bin
```
## GPIO Definition 
The default configuration is given below. It includes an encoder, an IR remote and a LCD or OLED.  
To add or edit GPIO definitions and add or remove some devices, you may need a hardware configuration file. Some examples are in the boards directory.  
See the file main/include/gpio.h and main/include/addon.h  
WARNING: this configuration will not work for a wrover processor. 
You need an adapted csv configuration.

## First use
- If the access point of your router is not known, the webradio initialize itself as an AP. Connect the wifi of your computer to the ssid "WifiKaRadio",  
- Browse to 192.168.4.1 to display the page, got to "setting" "Wifi" and configure your ssid ap, the password if any, the wanted IP or use dhcp if you know how to retrieve the dhcp given ip (terminal or scan of the network).
- In the gateway field, enter the ip address of your router.
- Validate. The equipment restart to the new configuration. Connect your wifi to your AP and browse to the ip given in configuration.
- Congratulation, you can edit your own station list. Don't forget to save your stations list in case of problem or for new equipments.
- if the AP is already know by the esp32, the default ip is given by dhcp.
- a sample of stations list is on http://karadio.karawin.fr/WebStations.txt . Can be uploaded via the web page.        

To flash your KaRadio32 without generating it, you will need the files in the binaries directory.

The tool to use is here :  
http://espressif.com/en/support/download/other-tools  
(change the security of the installation directory to permit all)

See the image at :

### The scheme from tomasf71 : 
Just an example of a realization.  
 
![Scheme](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/karawin/Ka-Radio32/master/images/schemekaradio32.jpg)

## Audio output

In the Setting panel on the webpage of KaraDio32 you can set the desired output method for audio.

For output on a simple speaker or a general analog amplifier :

- DAC to use the built in DAC of the esp32
- PDM to output a PDM (Pulse Density Modulation) stream. Wiki on PDM : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulse-density_modulation

For output via addional I2S or VS1053 hardware :

- I2S for connection to ac external DAC
- I2SMERUS to connect a merus amplifier
- VS1053 to connect to a vs1053 board.

### Connecting a speaker, earphone or amplifier with DAC or PDM setting
You can connect the GPIO25 (left audio channel), GPIO26 (right audio channel) and Ground directly to a small loudspeaker, a simple earphone (like from an mp3 player) or the input of an analog amplifier. The quality is less perfect than using an I2S or VS1053 board, bit it is very simple hardware-wise.

Connect like this :

```
                         +------------------------------------+
ESP32-GPIO25 (left) -----+speaker/earphone/analog-amp (left)   +-----+
                         +------------------------------------+      |
                                                                     |
                         +------------------------------------+      |
ESP32-GPIO26 (right) ----+speaker/earphone/analog-amp (right  +------+
                         +------------------------------------+      |
                                                                     |
ESP32-GROUND --------------------------------------------------------+
```

### Reducing the analog output level
If the audio signal level is too high for your speaker, earphone or amplifier you can add a potentiometer to decrease the level. Connect the potentiometer like this (only pictured for 1 audio channel, for stereo you need 2 potentiometers or a stereo-potmeter.

```
                                     +--------------------------------------+
ESP32-GPIO25 (left) -------+   +-----+speaker/earphone/analog-amp (left)    +------+
                          +-+  |     +--------------------------------------+      |
                          +P+  |                                                   |
                          +o+--+                                                   |
                          +t+                                                      |
                          +++                                                      |
                           |                                                       |
ESP32-GROUND --------------+-------------------------------------------------------+
```

### Improving the audio quality with a filter
An analog DAC signal always has some noise that may cause some distortion on the audio output, especially on low volume passages in the sound. This noise can be decreased with a low-pass filter. The digital PDM signal needs allways low pass filter to convert the digital signal to an analog signal. Fortunately the speaker and earphone acts as a low pass filter, although not in a perfect way.

You can improve the analog signal with an external low-pass filter. A simple low-pass RC filter can be find on the internet, f.i. here :  
http://www.pavouk.org/hw/usbdac/en_index.html.

## Radio streams
If Karadio32 is configured to use ADC, PDM or I2S output (to an external dac) it can play audio streams in mp3 format. Other formats like AAC and WMV require too much dynamic memories and can not be played this way.

When you want to play other formats you add an external VS1053 decoder to Karadio. Details on the features of this decoder can be found here : http://www.vlsi.fi/en/products/vs1053.html

Many boards can be found at :  
https://www.aliexpress.com/wholesale?catId=0&initiative_id=SB_20180113141636&SearchText=vs1053b

## Handling streaming errors
Normally a radio station is played without interruption.

But when a connection to the server of the radio station is (temporarily) disrupted (due to internet problems or server problems) Karadio behaves as follows:

- Playing of the radio stream stops, after a short while Karadio retries to relaunch the connection to the radio stream.
- If the relaunch of the connection fails again, the webpage of Karadio then shows “invalid address” and goes into the stop state. If you have a display connected to Karadio it will then show the Date, Time and IP address.
- You can try to relaunch the connection manually by pressing “play” on the Karadio webpage, or resetting the ESP32.
- If the wifi is disconnected, the esp is rebooted.
